COREWAR/ASM        B2 - Elementary programming in C            Tek1 final project

NAME
    corewar

USAGE
    ./corewar [-dump nbr_cycle] [[-n prog_number] [-a load_address] prog_name] ...

DESCRIPTION
    -dump nbr_cycle dumps the memory after the nbr_cycle execution (if the round isn’t already over) with the following format: 32 bytes/line in hexadecimal (A0BCDEFE1DD3...)
    -n prog_number sets the next program’s number. By default, the first free number in the parameter order
    -a load_address sets the next program’s loading address. When no address is specified, optimize the addresses so that the processes are as far away from each other as possible. The addresses are MEM_SIZE modulo.

EXIT STATUS CODE
    0 if okay
    84 in case of error (wrong nb of arguments, invalid parameter, ...)
